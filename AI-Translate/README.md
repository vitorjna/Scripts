# AI Translation

The `AI-Translate` directory houses a Python script (`translate.py`) designed for automated text translation. This script leverages external APIs for its translation capabilities.

### Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vitorjna/Scripts.git
    cd Scripts/AI-Translate
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**: Before running the script, you need to set up your environment variables. A template is provided in `.env.example`. Copy this file to `.env` and fill in the necessary API keys and configurations.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and add your API keys
    ```

3.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed. There are no required Python packages.

4.  **Running the Script**: Execute the translation script from the `AI-Translate` directory:

    ```bash
    python translate.py
    ```

    Follow the on-screen prompts or refer to the script's internal documentation for specific usage instructions and parameters.
